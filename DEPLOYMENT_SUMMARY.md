# 🎯 Deployment Summary

## Why GitHub Pages Didn't Work

GitHub Pages only hosts **static** websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Your Flask app needs a **backend server** to run Python code. That's why you saw the README instead of your app!

## ✅ Solution: Deploy to Render.com (FREE)

### What You Need to Do:

#### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "My student dashboard app"
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_URL
git push -u origin main
```

#### **Step 2: Deploy on Render.com**
1. Go to **render.com** and sign up (FREE)
2. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Settings:
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `gunicorn app:app`
5. Click **"Create Web Service"**
6. Wait 5-10 minutes
7. Your app is live! 🎉

#### **Step 3: Your Live URL**
You'll get a URL like: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

## 📁 Files for Deployment

All these files are ready:
- ✅ `app.py` - Your Flask application
- ✅ `bunny.csv` - Sample student data (5 students)
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - All dependencies including gunicorn
- ✅ `Procfile` - Tells Render how to run your app
- ✅ `render.yaml` - Render configuration
- ✅ `templates/` - HTML pages
- ✅ `static/` - CSS styles
- ✅ `images/` - You already have 101.webp!

## 🖼️ Images Support

Your app now supports:
- ✅ `.jpg` files
- ✅ `.png` files  
- ✅ `.webp` files (like your 101.webp)

## 🧪 Test Your App

**Locally:**
```bash
python app.py
# Visit: http://localhost:5000
```

**After Deployment:**
- Visit your Render URL
- Login with roll number: 101 (Alice Johnson)
- You should see graphs + image!

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **CSV File**: The `bunny.csv` file should be committed to GitHub so Render can access it
2. **Images**: Your `101.webp` image will work automatically on deployment
3. **More Images**: Add more student photos to the `images/` folder
4. **Your Own Data**: Replace `bunny.csv` with your actual student data

## 🔍 What Happened?

- **GitHub Pages** = Only static files (shows README)
- **Render.com** = Full Python backend (shows your app!)
- Both platforms serve your website, but Render can **execute code**

## ⚡ Quick Start After Deployment

1. Visit your Render URL
2. Enter roll number: **101**, **102**, **103**, **104**, or **105**
3. Click "View Dashboard"
4. See beautiful graphs! 📊
