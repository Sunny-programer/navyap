# Fix for Render.com Deployment Error

## The Problem
Your deployment failed because:
- **Python 3.13.4** is too new
- **pandas 2.1.3** doesn't support Python 3.13 yet
- This causes build errors

## ✅ The Solution

I've updated the files to use compatible versions:
- ✅ **runtime.txt** - Specifies Python 3.11
- ✅ **requirements.txt** - Updated to newer versions that work with Python 3.11
- ✅ **render.yaml** - Updated to use Python 3.11

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Push the Updated Files to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Python version compatibility"
git push
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Render.com
- Go to your Render.com dashboard
- Click on your service
- Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
- Wait for the build to complete (5-10 minutes)

### Alternative: Create New Deployment
If the above doesn't work:
1. On Render.com, go to **Settings** for your service
2. Under **Environment Variables**, add:
   - Key: `PYTHON_VERSION`
   - Value: `3.11.0`
3. Save and rebuild

## What Changed?

**Old (not working):**
```txt
Python 3.13.4 ❌
pandas==2.1.3 ❌
```

**New (working):**
```txt
Python 3.11.0 ✅
pandas>=2.2.0 ✅
```

## Why This Works

- **Python 3.11** is stable and well-supported
- **pandas >=2.2.0** has better Python 3.11 support
- All other packages have compatible versions
- Pillow added for better image support

## After Deployment

Your app will work at: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

Test with roll numbers: 101, 102, 103, 104, or 105

**Note:** The first deploy might take 10-15 minutes as it installs all packages.
